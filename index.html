            The grand clock struck four as <strong>Ms. Whitmore</strong>, pale as the porcelain in her hand, 
            collapsed onto the blood-red roses of her garden party. The teacup shattered, its contents 
            <em>reeking of bitter almonds</em>‚Äîthe telltale scent of cyanide. Four shadows loomed over her 
            convulsing form... but which one held death in their heart?
